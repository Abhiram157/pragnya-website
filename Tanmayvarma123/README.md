#About ME\
Hey everyone, I'm Tanmay Varma and I'm 19 years old. I'm currently pursuing my UC in BTECH CSE at GITAM university VIZAG. Coming to my goals and ambitions I've not decided anything yet and I'm still figuring out what to do in life. Right now I just want to complete my UG and decide on the rest later. I do like playing video games (I'm not addicted to them). I like exploring a lot of things online and I try to learn new stuff. I like fiddling with stuff and trying to know how they work and look from the inside. I used to like coding but right now I've lost interest because I'm not sure where to start now after learning the basics of two languages c and python. I'm trying to get back to coding now. That's it about me. Thanks for hopping in .
