# BORIGI HARSHINI  
Hi! I’m Borigi Harshini, a computer science engineering student. I’m a hard-working, passionate person who believes in the importance of education and accessibility to technological advancements.I have chosen to study computer science because I am fascinated by how computers work and I spend most of my spare time designing programs and web pages because I enjoy problem solving and logical thinking...    
I like to perform Yoga because it keeps me fit and improves my strength, balance and flexibility    
Throughout my academic life, I have had different ideas about what career I would pursue in the future.    
I am excited to learn more about this field.
