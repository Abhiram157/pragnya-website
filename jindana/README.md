# Jaishish  
  
Hello there!  
  
My name is Jaishish.  
  
Here's a few things about me -  
  
- I fancy sweets. Definitely to an unhealty extent, but nonetheless, sweets are sweet.  
  
- I like exploring the the hidden treasures of nature. There's quite a lot to see.  
  
- I like songs, there isn't a specific genre that I stick to, the song just has to feel right.  
  
- Be it in books or movies, I seem to find myself often picking stuff from the fantasy genre, specifically, magic, dragons, knights - the whole thing.
