# Meghana
Myself Meghana,



Pursuing B.Tech 2nd year in Gitam University  
I like learning new things everyday    
I enjoy playing chess and swimming  
But more than that exploring more tools while editing photos and videos is what I do.  
I like to move objects through animation  
Reading books the one thing that always keeps me away from procrastination  
I apprecitiate a good literature and good poetic touch in songs.
