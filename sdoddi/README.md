# Satvika Doddi

Hi, this is satvika. I did my schooling in Sri Sathya sai vidya vihar. I like to learn new things. I am a part of AIESEC in Visakhapatnam. In the coming years, I want to see myself with a masters degree and a prominent job in the IT industry.
Also, I am a tennis player, I represented Andhra Pradesh as the girls' team captain. Being in sports helped me shape my personality, fight all odds, and makes me the strong person I am now.
