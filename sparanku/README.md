Hi, I am Shreyas. My current academic endeavor is B.Tech in CSE. I'm currently a member of the **GUSAC** club. I am a passionate coder that strives to solve any challenge that comes my way. In the near future, I want to establish myself as someone who is self-reliant, unwavering, and has a prominent role in the IT industry. I enjoy learning new stuff. It's much fun for me to get to know new individuals. I enjoy learning about space and all the theory's which have been published till now. I want to understand every part of our *galaxy*.
